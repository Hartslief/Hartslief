Hello! Im C Hartslief. I am a 20 year old university student, from South Africa, 
soon to be studying a Bachelors of Computer Science and Information Technology in Development 
at Varsity Collge!

I will begin my studies next year. 
This Github account will be where I share most of my personal projects as well as collaborations with my friends/other students.

My goals for while I study are as follows:
- Create an Android/IOS App
- Create a webpage that functions on desktop as well as mobile
- Work on a cloud development project
- Work on a Machine Learning project
- Type over 100Wpm
- Create a game and sell it on steam
- Complete an internship

I think my biggest goal overall, and the reason why I got into programming in the first place, is to just learn as much as I can! 

I am currently learning the basics of coding, but I plan to complete a few bootcamps before I university begins! 
I will link my blog once I create the website for it!
